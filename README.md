# Repo/Journal for my personal reference to store key problems in my professional development.

# This won't be pretty and that is ok.  Feel free to traverse this repo.  It is a work in progress.

# This is to keep me out of the vacuum whilst learning on my own.

# I plan to recycle this for technical blog posts.
